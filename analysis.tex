\chapter{Analysis\label{cha:analysis}}
This chapter is all about testing how much of the prototype functionality.
We use the words experiment and prototype interchangeably here.
This is usually not an integrated prototype at week 12, but module test.
In the three week period, you will be refining it into an early integrated prototype.
See Chapter 14 of the textbook\cite{ulrich2020product-design-development}

Start by answering: "`What needed to be prototyped and why?"'

\section{\DP1 rotating thing}
How did you setup your prototypes (see exhibit 14-14 in \cite{ulrich2020product-design-development} to see how to make a test plan)?
Include quantitative data from prototypes when you execute the plan.
Analyze the results.
How does this relate to the metrics/requirements?
Include pictures/diagrams of prototype(s).

\section{\DP2 gorobi api}
How did you setup your prototypes (see exhibit 14-14 in \cite{ulrich2020product-design-development} to see how to make a test plan)?
Include quantitative data from prototypes when you execute the plan.
Analyze the results.
How does this relate to the metrics/requirements?
Include pictures/diagrams of prototype(s).


\section{\DP3  financial risk method XXX}
How did you setup your prototypes (see exhibit 14-14 in \cite{ulrich2020product-design-development} to see how to make a test plan)?
Include quantitative data from prototypes when you execute the plan.
Analyze the results.
How does this relate to the metrics/requirements?
Include pictures/diagrams of prototype(s).

\section{Stakeholder Feedback on Early Prorotypes}
Show the 12 and 15 week prototypes to your stakeholder.
What did they think about it:  acceptable, needs improvement, feature requests, etc.

\section{Integrated Prototype}
Hopefully, by week 15 you will have the beginnings of a complete system.
How did you setup your prototypes (see exhibit 14-14 in \cite{ulrich2020product-design-development} to see how to make a test plan)?
Include quantitative data from prototypes when you execute the plan.
Analyze the results.
How does this relate to the metrics/requirements?
Include pictures/diagrams of prototype(s).

Show the 15 week prototypes to your stakeholder.
What did they think about it:  acceptable, needs improvement, feature requests, etc.
